# Vue 3 + Vite

<p>Server side for eshop. Using Vue3 + Vite. App was build using docker so it's recommended to use it.</p> 
<p>After you start docker container use docker exec -it vite_docker sh</p>
<p>Now you can use npm install and npm run dev to start your server working.</p>
<p>Products page with cart is presented. Uses API from eshop-adminpanel(https://github.com/revengergodx/eshop-adminpanel) so make sure its enabled and working</p>

<h3>Recomendations:</h3>
<p>On product page when you choose size, choosen size is made active and change background to blue. Only one active size allowed.</p>
<p>Same with colors. When color is chooses it change his shape to circle.</p>
<p>After you choose products and open cart you need to enter Name, email and address so data will be passed to API eshop-adminpanel</p>
